  Abstract                 = {Abstract Correspondences between the Thomson problem and atomic electron shell-filling patterns are observed as systematic non-uniformities in the distribution of potential energy necessary to change configurations of N ≤ 100 electrons into discrete geometries of neighboring N − 1 systems. These non-uniformities yield electron energy pairs, intra-subshell pattern similarities with empirical ionization energy, and a salient pattern that coincides with size-normalized empirical ionization energies. Spatial symmetry limitations on discrete charges constrained to a spherical volume are conjectured as underlying physical mechanisms responsible for shell-filling patterns in atomic electronic structure and the Periodic Law. },
