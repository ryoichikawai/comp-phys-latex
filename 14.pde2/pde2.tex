\chapter{Partial Differential Equations II: Elliptic Equations}\label{ch:pde-heat}

In this chapter, we develop numerical methods for Laplace equation in the two-dimensional space, a simple partial differential equation of the elliptic type. We begin with a simple iterative algorithm known as relaxation method and improve it with a similar iterative method called simultaneous overrelaxation.

\section{Laplace equation}

Consider a scalar field $\phi(\vb{r})$ which satisfies Laplace equation
\begin{equation}\label{eq:laplace}
\laplacian \phi(\vb{r}) = 0.
\end{equation}
This equation is one of essential equations in the theory of electromagnetism.  It also appears in other physics such as fluid dynamics.  In this chapter we focus on the two-dimensional version of the Laplace equation
\begin{equation}
\pdv[2]{\phi(x,y)}{x} + \pdv[2]{\phi(x,y)}{y} = 0
\end{equation}
For simplicity, we consider a rectangular space with diagonal corners $(0,0)$ and $(L_x,L_y)$.
We will consider two types of boundary conditions,  the Dirichlet conditions
\begin{equation}
\phi(0,y)=a, \quad \phi(L_x,y) = b), \quad \phi(x,0) = c, \quad \phi(x,L_y) = d
\end{equation}
or Neumann codintions
\begin{equation}
\phi_x(0,y)=a, \quad \phi_x(L_x,y) = b), \quad \phi_y(x,0) = c, \quad \phi_y(x,L_y) = d
\end{equation}
where $\phi_x = \pdv{\phi}{x}$ and $\phi_y = \pdv{\phi}{y}$.


To solve equation, Eq. \eqref{laplace}, we consider diffusion in the two-dimensional space.  The diffusion equation
\begin{equation}
\pdv{t} \rho(x,y,t) = D \left( \pdv[2]{x} \rho(x,y,t) + \pdv[2]{y} \rho(x,y,t) \right)
\end{equation}
where $D$ is the diffusion constant.  We already calculated the one-dimensional version of this equation in Chapter \ref{ch:pde1}.
It is known that the solution to the diffusion equation approach an time-independent solution called steady state
